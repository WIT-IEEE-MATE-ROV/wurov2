## IEEE Wentworth Underwater Robotics Team 

## What is this?
This is code to control an underwater ROV/AUV from a surface station. 

## File structure
This repository uses the de-facto directory standard found in ROS workspaces.

- `config` contains configuration files, keeping them in one place rather than cluttering up the repository. See the README in that directory for more information.
- `docs` contains more documentation.
- `launch` contains launch files. The files here allow you to run existing configurations in simulation, real life, etc.
- `msg` contains ROS message templates. These are used to pass information from one process to another.
